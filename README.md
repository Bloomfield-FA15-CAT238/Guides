# Guides

Here are some useful tips for this class. 

## Version Control

For this class, all assignments are being submitted via GitHub, so you will need to get used to using Git (or even use SVN).

### Install a client

One of the easiest solutions is to install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) or [install TortoiseGit](Installing-TortoiseGIT/README.md) which is more like working in Windows Explorer.

### Using a client 

Once you have something installed, then you can read:
* [How to get a repo from GitHub](Getting-Stuff/README.md) 

After you have that inital connection to the GitHub repository then you can read:
* [How to get updates from a GitHub repo](Updating-From-GitHub/README.md)
* [How to submit your changes to a GitHub repo](Sending-Stuff/README.md)

### Client documentation

Here are some links to the clients that we will support:
* [GitHub Desktop](https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/contributing/)
* [TortoiseGit](https://tortoisegit.org/docs/tortoisegit/)
* [TortoiseSVN](http://tortoisesvn.net/docs/release/TortoiseSVN_en/index.html)
